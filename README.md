# Analytics Engineering Project on Olive oil sales across USA

## Overview
This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of **data engineering and analytics**, focusing on **pipelining data from an external source into a database for visualization**. It covers the complete workflow from **data extraction, transformation, and modeling** to **insightful visualization** for data-driven decision-making.

## Project Workflow

### **Building an ETL Pipeline**
- Understanding **ETLs** and their role in data pipelines.
- Setting up the **Python environment** for data extraction and transformation.
- Performing **data transformation** to clean, format, and standardize raw data.
- **Loading** transformed data into a **database** for structured storage.

### **Data Transformation & Modeling**
- Learning **data modeling concepts** for optimized analytics.
- Constructing a **data model** to organize and structure datasets efficiently.
- Ensuring **data cleanliness** by handling missing values and inconsistencies.
- **Joining tables** to create meaningful and structured **views** for analysis.

### **Visualizing Data**
- Understanding the **importance of data visualization** in decision-making.
- **Connecting** to the transformed data model for analysis.
- **Creating dashboards** that present **key insights and trends**.
- **Publishing interactive dashboards** to communicate findings effectively.

## Tech Stack and Tools
- **Python** – Used for data extraction, transformation, and automation.
- **Database (SQL/PostgreSQL/MySQL)** – Stores structured, transformed data.
- **GitHub Codespaces** – Provides an instant **cloud-based development environment**.
- **Tableau/Power BI** – Used for **data visualization and storytelling**.

## Data Transformation & Modeling
- **Extracting raw data** from external sources.
- **Transforming and cleaning** the dataset using Python.
- **Structuring data models** for efficient querying.
- **Creating relationships** between tables for comprehensive analysis.

## Results and Insights
- Developed a robust **ETL pipeline** to handle and process data.
- Structured **data models** to improve analysis efficiency.
- Built **interactive Tableau dashboards** to visualize key insights.
- Enhanced data accessibility and usability for business stakeholders.
